### 3. Create Task List

Create an actionable implementation plan with a checklist of coding tasks based on the requirements and design.
The tasks document should be based on the requirement and design documents, so ensure these exists first.

**Constraints:**

**Feature Discovery:**
- The user provides the {feature_name} as part of the prompt, or by way of the current branch which will contain the name of the feature, either in whole or prefixed by specs/
- Verify that the specs/{feature_name} folder exists and has a requirements.md and design.md file
- If the folder does NOT exist, the model SHOULD check the current git branch and see if that matches an existing feature
- The model MUST request the user to provide the {feature_name} using the question "I can't find this feature, can you provide it again? Based on the git branch, I think it might be {found_name}"
- If the requirements.md or design.md file does not exist in the folder, the model MUST inform the user that they need to use the requirements and design skills to create these first
- If a decision_log.md file exists in the specs/{feature_name} folder, the decisions in there MUST be followed

**Task Planning Approach:**
- The model MUST create a 'specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- Convert the feature design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner
- Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage
- Each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together
- There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step
- Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code

**Task Format Requirements:**
- The model MUST format the implementation plan as a numbered checkbox list with a maximum of two levels of hierarchy:
  - Top-level items (like epics) should be used only when needed
  - Sub-tasks should be numbered with decimal notation (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
  - Each item must be a checkbox
  - Simple structure is preferred
- The model MAY optionally group tasks into phases for additional clarity:
  - Phases are optional organizational aids, not required
  - Common phase examples include: pre-work, implement changes, code cleanup, documentation
  - Phases should improve readability without adding unnecessary complexity
  - Tasks within phases still follow the same numbering and format requirements
- Each task item MUST include:
  - A clear objective as the task description that involves writing, modifying, or testing code
  - Additional information as sub-bullets under the task
  - Specific references to requirements from the requirements document (referencing granular sub-requirements, not just user stories)

**Task Content Requirements:**
- Each task MUST be actionable by a coding agent:
  - Involve writing, modifying, or testing specific code components
  - Specify what files or components need to be created or modified
  - Be concrete enough that a coding agent can execute them without additional clarification
  - Be scoped to specific coding activities (e.g., "Implement X function" rather than "Support X feature")
- Tasks MUST build incrementally on previous steps
- The task list's scope MUST match the source document's scope: no tasks for work the requirements/design do not cover, and no covered work left untasked (spec-conventions `SJ-SCOPE-001`)
- Tasks appended in later passes MUST carry the same schema as the file's existing tasks — same metadata shape (details, requirement links, `blocked_by`/stream usage) and same stable-ID style (spec-conventions `SJ-TASK-*`)

**Task Granularity — No Inflation:**

A task represents a meaningful unit of work that moves the feature forward. Task lists bloat when agents fragment coherent changes into trivial substeps; this wastes execution time and obscures the real shape of the work.

- The model MUST NOT split a single coherent change into separate tasks for setup, implementation, and wiring when the work is small enough to be done together (e.g., do NOT create "create file", "add import", "add function stub", "implement body" as four tasks when they form one cohesive edit). The TDD pairing rule is the only mandated split — beyond it, combine.
- A task SHOULD be substantial enough that completing it represents recognisable progress. If a task takes only a line or two of code and has no independent test, it probably belongs merged into an adjacent task.
- Phases MUST NOT be added for decorative structure. Use phases only when they group genuinely distinct stages of work (e.g., schema migration before API changes). A single-phase list is preferable to invented phases.
- Streams MUST NOT be added when tasks cannot actually run in parallel. A single stream is the default; only split into multiple streams when independent work exists AND parallel execution is realistic.
- Task `details` sub-bullets MUST add decision-relevant information (file paths, behavioral constraints, edge cases to cover). They MUST NOT restate the task title, explain what a test is for, or describe obvious implementation steps.

- The model MUST use red/green TDD ordering for all implementation tasks:
  - **Red**: Write a failing test first that defines the expected behaviour (e.g., task 1.1 writes unit tests for the interface/function)
  - **Green**: Implement the minimum code to make the test pass (e.g., task 1.2 implements the function)
  - Every implementation task MUST be preceded by a test task that will initially fail against the unimplemented code
  - The test task and its corresponding implementation task MUST be adjacent and clearly paired (e.g., "1.1 Write tests for X" followed by "1.2 Implement X to pass tests")
  - Tasks that only modify configuration, types/interfaces, or wiring are exempt from requiring a preceding test task
- If the design specifies property-based testing for certain components, the model MUST include explicit tasks for writing property tests before or alongside unit tests for those components
- The plan MUST cover all aspects of the design that can be implemented through code
- All requirements MUST be covered by the implementation tasks
- If gaps are identified during implementation planning, the model MUST mention them and propose relevant changes to the requirements or design

**Task Dependencies:**
- The model MUST identify dependencies between tasks using `blocked_by` relationships
- A task that requires another task to be completed first MUST declare that dependency
- Common dependency patterns include:
  - Tests blocked by the interfaces/types they test
  - Integration code blocked by the components being integrated
  - Higher-level features blocked by lower-level building blocks
- Dependencies MUST be expressed as task IDs (e.g., `"blocked_by": ["1", "2"]`)
- Circular dependencies are not allowed and indicate a design problem

**Work Streams for Parallel Execution:**
- The model MUST analyze tasks to identify independent work streams that can be executed in parallel
- A work stream is a set of tasks that can be worked on independently from other streams
- Common stream patterns include:
  - Frontend vs Backend work
  - Different modules or components with no shared code
  - Independent features that don't interact
  - Test writing vs implementation (when tests can be written from interfaces)
- Tasks in the same stream should be numbered sequentially and share the same stream ID
- The default stream is 1; additional streams use 2, 3, etc.
- Tasks SHOULD be assigned to streams based on:
  - Code locality (same files/modules = same stream)
  - Logical grouping (related functionality = same stream)
  - Dependency chains (dependent tasks should generally be in the same stream)
- Cross-stream dependencies are allowed and enable coordination between parallel agents

**Task Exclusions:**
The model MUST NOT include the following types of non-coding tasks in the main tasks.md:
- User acceptance testing or user feedback gathering
- Deployment to production or staging environments
- Performance metrics gathering or analysis
- Running the application to test end to end flows (automated tests to test end-to-end flows from a user perspective are allowed)
- User training or documentation creation
- Business process changes or organizational changes
- Marketing or communication activities
- Any task that cannot be completed through writing, modifying, or testing code

**User Prerequisites (Optional):**
If the feature requires manual configuration or setup steps that cannot be performed by the agent, the model MUST create a separate `specs/{feature_name}/prerequisites.md` file.

Prerequisites are tasks that require human intervention outside of code, such as:
- Xcode project configuration (capabilities, entitlements, signing)
- Apple Developer portal setup (App IDs, certificates, provisioning profiles)
- Cloud console configuration (AWS, GCP, Azure resources)
- Third-party service setup (API keys, webhooks, OAuth apps)
- Database provisioning or schema migrations requiring admin access
- Environment variable configuration in deployment platforms
- DNS or domain configuration
- App store or marketplace registration

**Prerequisites Format:**
```markdown
# Prerequisites for {Feature Name}

These tasks must be completed by the user before or during implementation.

## Before Starting
- [ ] {Task that must be done before any coding begins}

## During Implementation
- [ ] {Task needed before a specific coding task, reference which task}

## Before Testing
- [ ] {Task needed before testing can occur}
```

**Prerequisites Constraints:**
- Only create prerequisites.md if there are actual prerequisites identified
- Each prerequisite MUST include clear instructions on what needs to be configured
- Prerequisites SHOULD indicate when they need to be completed (before starting, during implementation, before testing)
- Prerequisites that block specific coding tasks MUST reference which task they block
- The model MUST ask the user to confirm prerequisites are complete before proceeding with dependent tasks during implementation

**Self-Check (before presenting to user):**
After creating or updating the tasks file, the model MUST perform these checks before asking for approval:

1. **Red/green TDD ordering**: Verify every implementation task is preceded by a test task that will fail against the unimplemented code. The only exceptions are tasks that deal with configuration, types/interfaces, or wiring.
2. **Rune list validation**: Run `rune list specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md` and verify:
   - All tasks render correctly with proper numbering and hierarchy
   - Phase groupings display as expected
   - Stream assignments are present where specified
   - Dependencies (`blocked_by`) are shown and reference valid task IDs
   - No parsing errors or warnings are reported
3. **Requirement coverage**: Confirm every requirement from requirements.md is referenced by at least one task
4. **No orphaned tasks**: Verify no task exists in isolation without being connected to the incremental build chain
5. **No circular dependencies**: Confirm the dependency graph has no cycles
6. **Non-goals respected**: Confirm no task implements or prepares for any capability listed in the requirements' Non-Goals / Out-of-Scope section
7. **No granularity inflation**: Confirm no coherent change has been fragmented across multiple trivial tasks (beyond the mandated TDD test/implement pair), and that phases and streams are present only where they serve a real purpose

If any check fails, the model MUST fix the issue and re-run the checks before presenting to the user.

**Approval Workflow:**
- After updating the tasks document, the model MUST ask the user "Do the tasks look good?"
- The **default action** at this gate is `/sendit`. Offer it as the recommended choice (alongside approving now to continue, or requesting changes inline): `/sendit` copies the spec docs to the user's Prism review folder and closes out the session so the user can review the document at their leisure. If the user picks `/sendit`, invoke the sendit skill and stop.
- The model MUST make modifications to the tasks document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the tasks document
- The model MUST NOT consider the workflow complete until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- The model MUST stop once the task document has been approved

**Workflow Scope — HARD RULE, No Source Edits:**
This workflow is ONLY for creating design and planning artifacts. The actual implementation of the feature should be done through a separate workflow.
- The model MUST NOT attempt to implement the feature as part of this workflow
- The model MUST NOT edit source files — even when a task looks like "purely a code edit"; the deliverables are documents and the task list, nothing else
- Instrumentation, logging, or probes added "to gather information for the plan" count as implementation — record them as tasks instead
- The model MUST clearly communicate to the user that this workflow is complete once the design and planning artifacts are created

**Rune CLI Task Creation:**
The model MUST use the rune skill to create and manage tasks. Invoke the rune skill with instructions to:
- Create the task file at specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md with appropriate title and references (requirements.md, design.md, decision_log.md)
- Add tasks using batch operations with proper structure including:
  - Task titles that are clear and actionable
  - Phase groupings where appropriate
  - Parent-child relationships for subtasks
  - Details as arrays for additional context
  - References as arrays of file paths
  - Requirements as arrays of requirement IDs from requirements.md
  - Stream assignments for parallel execution (`stream`: integer)
  - Dependencies between tasks (`blocked_by`: array of task IDs)

The rune skill will handle the proper command syntax and JSON formatting automatically.

**Stream Assignment Guidelines:**
When creating tasks, the model SHOULD:
1. First identify all tasks that have no dependencies on other tasks - these can start immediately
2. Group related tasks into streams based on code locality and logical relationships
3. Assign stream IDs consistently (all backend tasks in stream 1, all frontend in stream 2, etc.)
4. Ensure tasks within a stream that depend on each other use `blocked_by`
5. Cross-stream dependencies should be minimized but used when necessary

Example batch operation with streams and dependencies:
```json
{
  "file": "tasks.md",
  "operations": [
    {"type": "add", "title": "Define API interfaces", "stream": 1, "phase": "Implementation"},
    {"type": "add", "title": "Implement API handlers", "stream": 1, "blocked_by": ["1"], "phase": "Implementation"},
    {"type": "add", "title": "Create UI components", "stream": 2, "phase": "Implementation"},
    {"type": "add", "title": "Wire UI to API", "stream": 2, "blocked_by": ["2", "3"], "phase": "Implementation"}
  ]
}
```
