# Pre-Push Code Review

Review and fix unpushed commits before they reach the remote repository.

## Phase 1: Identify Changes

Determine which commits haven't been pushed to the remote repository. Record the base as the merge base, `BASE=$(git merge-base origin/<branch> HEAD)`, and use `git diff $BASE..HEAD` to get the full diff of unpushed changes; a two-dot diff straight against `origin/<branch>` shows reverse changes when the branch is behind it. Show the user which commits will be reviewed.

If there is no remote tracking branch yet, use `origin/main` in place of `origin/<branch>`. Phase 7 compares the working tree against `BASE`.

**Working directory.** Every generated input — diff fragments, JUnit and coverage files, the diagram, the review JSON itself — lives in `$INPUTS`, outside the working tree so nothing lands in `git status`:

```bash
INPUTS="${CLAUDE_JOB_DIR:-$(mktemp -d)}/review-inputs"; mkdir -p "$INPUTS"
```

Both `$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR` and `mktemp -d` yield absolute paths; never use a relative one.

## Phase 2: Locate Relevant Specifications

Check if there's a spec for the feature being worked on:

- Examine the current branch name for feature indicators
- Look in the specs directory for matching feature folders
- Review all documents in the feature folder: requirements, design, tasks, and decision log
- If no spec exists, proceed with general review only

## Phase 3: Launch Review Agents in Parallel

Use the Agent tool to launch all agents concurrently in a single message. Pass each agent the full diff so it has the complete context.

### Agent 1: Code Reuse Review

For each change:

1. **Search for existing utilities and helpers** that could replace newly written code. Use Grep to find similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase — common locations are utility directories, shared modules, and files adjacent to the changed ones.
2. **Flag any new function that duplicates existing functionality.** Suggest the existing function to use instead.
3. **Flag any inline logic that could use an existing utility** — hand-rolled string manipulation, manual path handling, custom environment checks, ad-hoc type guards, and similar patterns are common candidates.

### Agent 2: Code Quality Review

Review the same changes for hacky patterns:

1. **Redundant state**: state that duplicates existing state, cached values that could be derived, observers/effects that could be direct calls
2. **Parameter sprawl**: adding new parameters to a function instead of generalizing or restructuring existing ones
3. **Copy-paste with slight variation**: near-duplicate code blocks that should be unified with a shared abstraction
4. **Leaky abstractions**: exposing internal details that should be encapsulated, or breaking existing abstraction boundaries
5. **Stringly-typed code**: using raw strings where constants, enums (string unions), or branded types already exist in the codebase

### Agent 3: Efficiency Review

Review the same changes for efficiency:

1. **Unnecessary work**: redundant computations, repeated file reads, duplicate network/API calls, N+1 patterns
2. **Missed concurrency**: independent operations run sequentially when they could run in parallel
3. **Hot-path bloat**: new blocking work added to startup or per-request/per-render hot paths
4. **Unnecessary existence checks**: pre-checking file/resource existence before operating (TOCTOU anti-pattern) — operate directly and handle the error
5. **Memory**: unbounded data structures, missing cleanup, event listener leaks
6. **Overly broad operations**: reading entire files when only a portion is needed, loading all items when filtering for one

### Agent 4: Spec & Documentation Review (only if spec exists)

1. **Spec adherence**: Verify implementation matches requirements and design. Identify divergences. Ensure divergences are documented in the decision log.
2. **Documentation**: Check if README, CLAUDE.md, or other docs need updates to reflect the changes.
3. **Testing gaps**: Verify presence of appropriate tests for new/modified code. Check that tests test behavior, not implementation.

## Phase 4: Fix Issues

Wait for all agents to complete. Aggregate their findings and fix each issue directly.

**Constraints:**

- **Do not modify test files** unless fixing an actual bug (e.g., a test that tests the wrong thing or has a genuine error). Refactoring production code must not require test changes — if it would, reconsider the refactoring approach.
- If a finding is a false positive or not worth addressing, skip it without debate.

## Phase 5: Verify

The verification run is also the source of the page's test results, so choose a command that emits JUnit XML before running anything, and run it once.

### Choose the command

Read `~/.claude/scripts/ecosystems.json`. The language row is the one whose `extensions` cover the most changed files; the runner within it is the first whose `detect` rule matches (`files` globs at the repo root, or top-level `package_json_keys` in `package.json`). Then, reading text only and executing nothing, take the first tier that applies:

1. **Makefile target.** A target whose literal recipe lines (read from the Makefile — never `make -n`, which still expands `$(shell …)` and runs `+` lines) contain one of the runner's `junit_flags`. Pass over a target whose output path is a `$(VAR)` reference you cannot read. Run the target and copy the outputs the recipe names into `$INPUTS`.
2. **Project instructions.** A command in CLAUDE.md or the README described as the test command, if it contains such a flag.
3. **Ecosystem recipe.** The runner's `recipe` with `{junit}`, `{coverage}`, and `{inputs}` replaced by absolute paths under `$INPUTS`, its `env` exported, and any `config_files` templates written under `$INPUTS` first. Every binary in `requires` must be on PATH; a missing one records `no_data_reason: "required tool missing"`. No row, or no runner whose `detect` rule matches, records `runner not detected`. Read the row's `notes` — they say where the coverage file lands, which extra JUnit files appear, and what the install line assumes.

A Makefile target or project command that emits nothing structured is passed over in favour of the next tier, not run as a second suite. `coverage_scope` is `repository` for tier 3 and `project-configured` for tiers 1 and 2; the page shows it.

### Run once

1. **Before:** record `git status --porcelain -z` and copy every dirty tracked file to `$INPUTS/pre-run/<path>` — those are the Phase 4 fixes and must survive.
2. **Run** the chosen command in one Bash call with `timeout: 600000` (the tool's maximum; it covers dependency installation and the tests) with every output under `$INPUTS`. The exit status becomes `run_outcome` (`passed` or `failed`). All tests must pass. Run linters and validators as specified in project configuration as well.
3. **After:** for each tracked file whose content differs from before, restore a file that was clean pre-run with `git checkout -- <path>` and copy a file that was dirty pre-run back from `$INPUTS/pre-run/`. Untracked files that appeared outside `$INPUTS` are reported, never deleted. List touched and appeared paths in `tests.run_touched_files`. Never use `git stash` — it would carry away the fixes the run exists to verify.
4. **On timeout:** keep whatever JUnit XML was written, set `run_outcome: "timed_out"` and `partial: true`, and add "fix verification incomplete: test run timed out" to `verdict.detail`.
5. If any test fails, investigate whether the fix introduced a regression and revert or adjust the fix — do not modify the test to make it pass. If you re-run after adjusting, repeat the before/after steps; the last run is the one the page reports.

## Phase 6: Generate Implementation Explanation and Insight Material

Use the explain-like skill (invoke the Skill tool with skill="explain-like") to generate explanations of the implementation at all three expertise levels (beginner, intermediate, expert). If a spec was found in Phase 2, write the explanation to `specs/{feature_name}/implementation.md`; otherwise keep it in memory for the HTML output only.

**Use the explanation as a validation mechanism:**

- If any requirement from the spec cannot be clearly explained, flag it as potentially incomplete.
- If the explanation reveals logic that doesn't align with the design, flag it as a divergence.
- Add a "Completeness Assessment" section summarizing: what's fully implemented, what's partially implemented, and what's missing.

**In addition to the three-level explanation, extract the following content from the diff, commit messages, and (if present) the decision log. This material feeds Phase 7 and should be saved into memory even when no spec exists:**

1. **Important changes** — the 3–7 commits or hunks that matter most for a reviewer. For each, record:
   - A one-line title (file or area + verb).
   - Why it matters (correctness, performance, API surface, user-visible behaviour, security).
   - The specific line range or symbol to look at.
2. **Learnings** — patterns, idioms, or APIs introduced in this branch that a reader could reuse elsewhere. Capture each as a short "takeaway" with a pointer to the example in the diff. Skip pure mechanical changes (renames, formatting).
3. **Decision rationale** — for each non-trivial choice, capture the reason. Source order: (a) decision log entries that match the commits, (b) commit message bodies, (c) inline code comments added in the diff, (d) inferred from the diff itself. Mark inferred entries explicitly as `inferred` so the reviewer knows the rationale wasn't stated by the author.

If a decision is non-trivial but no rationale can be found anywhere, list it under "Open questions for the author" rather than fabricating a reason.

## Phase 7: Generate Review HTML

Render a self-contained HTML page using the bundled renderer script. Do **not** hand-write the HTML — assemble a JSON description and invoke the script. The script owns the Prism Dark theme, the overview grid, the three-level explanation tabs, the important-change cards (with Takeaway / Rationale / Open-question callouts), and the diff rendering. Your job is to populate the JSON.

**Script:** `~/.claude/scripts/build_review_html.py`. The same renderer powers `pr-review-html` — keep changes to the template/palette in the script itself, not duplicated across skills.

**Output location** (in priority order, use the first that applies):

1. `specs/{feature_name}/pre-push-review.html` if a matching spec was found in Phase 2
2. `{repo-root}/.claude/pre-push-review.html` if `.claude/` exists
3. `/tmp/pre-push-review-{branch-name}.html`

Overwrite any existing file.

### Step 1: Write per-file diff fragments

Diffs come from the working tree after the fixes, so the coverage marks land on the lines the reader sees. For each changed file (`git diff --name-status -M $BASE`), write `git diff $BASE -- <path>` to `$INPUTS/<name>.txt`. Files listed by `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -z` are untracked additions: write `git diff --no-index /dev/null <path>` for them (exit status 1 is normal) and badge them `Added`. Keep the filenames simple (e.g. `diff-main.go.txt`); the JSON references them by name.

### Step 1b: Blast radius and classification

Run after Phase 5 so the working tree holds the fixes:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/blast_radius.py --repo . --snapshot working-tree --base "$BASE" --tools --out "$INPUTS"
```

This writes `$INPUTS/diagram.json` (the one-hop dependency graph) and `$INPUTS/diff-tests.json` (test declarations added and removed in changed test files). Reference both by file name; never transcribe them into the JSON. There is no forge lookup in this skill, so there is no baseline: new and removed tests always come from `diff-tests.json`.

**Classification** — the renderer classifies every `files[]` entry as `code`, `docs` (`.md`, `.rst`, `.adoc` and similar, anything under a `docs/` directory, and `README`, `CHANGELOG`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`, or `CODEOWNERS` files with any extension), or `other` (images, lockfiles, editor/VCS dotfiles such as `.gitignore`); groups the per-file diffs by kind; and treats the change as docs-only when no file is `code`. CI workflows, build configuration, dependency manifests, and `.txt` files outside `docs/` are `code`. Set `files[].kind` to override one file, or `change_classification` (`code` | `docs-only`) to override the whole change; otherwise leave both out.

### Step 2: Assemble `review.json`

Write a JSON file with this shape. Every top-level key is optional except `repo` and `files` — empty sections are omitted from both the body and the TOC.

```jsonc

    "summary":  "1-3 sentence headline finding shown in the feed reader."
  }
}
```

For a docs-only change (derived, or `change_classification: "docs-only"`) the Tests card, Tests section, and diagram are all omitted, whatever else is present.

**Rendering contract** the script implements (you don't have to):
- Pass-through HTML fields: `subtitle`, `at_a_glance` items, `verdict.detail`, every `explanation` panel, `decisions[].body`, `double_check[].body`. Write actual HTML here (e.g. `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<code>`).
- Every other field is HTML-escaped automatically. Write plain text, no escaping.
- Diffs are escaped and coloured by the script's own stylesheet — no external assets. Added lines that have coverage data and zero hits carry an uncovered mark; added lines in files with no coverage data carry none.
- The Per-file diffs section opens with the composition (`6 files: 4 code · 1 docs · 1 other`) and, when more than one kind is present, groups the diffs under Code, Docs, and Other headings in that order, keeping the JSON order within each group.
- The three-level explanation renders as CSS-only radio-button tabs in Beginner → Intermediate → Expert order. The first level present is checked by default.
- Important-change cards render a magenta-bordered Takeaway callout and a cyan-bordered Rationale callout. `rationale_unknown: true` swaps the Rationale for a warning-bordered "Open question" callout. `rationale_inferred: true` appends a muted `(inferred — not stated by the author)`.
- Findings counts (raised / fixed / skipped) are derived from the `status` field.
- `tests` renders a Tests card in the overview grid (pass rate, new tests, diff coverage) and a Tests section: provenance, availability of run / JUnit / coverage / baseline as independent states, totals with the flaky count, failed tests with messages redacted for secrets and truncated to 500 characters, new and removed tests by declaration name from `diff_tests_file` (labelled diff-derived), a per-file diff-coverage table, touched files, and any warnings. With no readable results it renders a no-data card from `no_data_reason`.
- `diagram_file` renders the Blast radius section as inline SVG before the per-file diffs: dependents, changed files, dependencies, grouped by package or directory, changed nodes linked to their diff. Test files leave the side columns, packages with more than 3 expansion-only files collapse, side columns cap at 15 nodes. An absent or invalid file warns and omits the section.
- The TOC, overview cards, and per-section anchors are generated automatically; sections with no data are dropped.
- `publish_metadata` is emitted as a `<script type="application/json" id="review-meta">` block in `<head>`, JSON-encoded with `</` escaped. Required by `pulsar publish` (see `docs/agent-contract.md` in the pulsar repo); harmless in browsers when present, ignored when absent.

### Step 3: Invoke the script

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/build_review_html.py \
  --data    "$INPUTS/review.json" \
  --output  /path/to/pre-push-review.html \
  --diff-dir "$INPUTS"
```

Always pass `--diff-dir` explicitly; every file the JSON references (fragments, JUnit, coverage, `diagram.json`, `diff-tests.json`) is resolved against it. The script prints the output path on success. Surface that path to the user so they can open it in a browser.

**Error handling.** Missing diff fragments show as `(diff fragment 'name.txt' missing)` placeholders. A test, coverage, or diagram input that is missing, malformed, not UTF-8, over 50 MB, or XML with a `DOCTYPE` prints a `warning:` line naming the file, is listed in the Tests section, and the rest of the page still renders with exit status 0. A malformed or unreadable `review.json` does not render: the script prints one line naming the problem and exits non-zero, so fix the JSON and run it again.

**Severity floor.** When a `tests` block is present and the change is not docs-only, the script's last two stderr lines are `summary coverage: matched=N unmatched=N` and `summary tests: passed=N failed=N errored=N skipped=N flaky=N`. Grep stderr for the `summary tests:` prefix. If `failed` or `errored` is non-zero: set `verdict.tone` to `warning` unless it is already `error`, prepend the failure count to `verdict.detail` (e.g. "3 failing tests — "), raise `publish_metadata.severity` to `needs-changes` unless it is already `blocking`, and run the script again to the same output path. When the line is absent there is no test data and no floor applies. Flaky tests and coverage values never change the verdict or severity.

### When to edit the renderer vs the SKILL.md

- **Edit the renderer** (the `~/.claude/scripts/review_html/` package; `build_review_html.py` is only the command line) when you need a new card, callout colour, layout tweak, or theme adjustment. The Prism Dark palette lives in `review_html/css.py`; section markup in `sections.py`, the Tests section in `tests_section.py`, the diagram in `diagram.py`. Changes there are shared with `pr-review-html` and `pr-overview`; `make test` in the agentic-coding repo covers them.
- **Edit the SKILL.md** when you change the JSON contract, the location-priority logic, or the upstream phase semantics.

### Populating `publish_metadata`

Always populate this field. Mapping rules:

- `title`: human-readable, mirror the H1 (e.g. `Pre-push review: <branch>`).
- `repoUrl`: from `git remote get-url origin`; the binary normalises SSH → HTTPS and strips `.git`.
- `branch`: the current branch name. **Do not** set `pr` for a pre-push review — no PR exists yet.
- `severity`: derive from the verdict tone and findings — `success`/no major findings → `lgtm`; `warning` with only nits → `suggestions`; major findings raised → `needs-changes`; blocking/security/correctness issues → `blocking`. Failing or errored tests floor it at `needs-changes` (Step 3).
- `summary`: 1–3 sentences leading with the headline finding (not "I reviewed X"). This is what shows up in the user's feed reader.

## Phase 8: Publish

Check whether the `pulsar` binary is on PATH (`command -v pulsar`). If it is, invoke `pulsar publish <path-to-html>` — the binary validates the metadata block, normalises the repo URL, moves the file into `$HOME/CodeReviews/YYYY-MM/`, and deletes the source. Treat a non-zero exit code as a hard error and surface the stderr message verbatim. If `pulsar` is not on PATH, skip this phase silently.

## Phase 9: Summary

Provide a clear verdict: **Ready to push**, **Needs fixes** (with must-fix list), or **Requires discussion** (with architectural concerns).

List what was fixed automatically and what still needs attention. Include the path to the review HTML from Phase 7 (or the archived path returned by Phase 8 if publish ran).
