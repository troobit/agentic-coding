# PR Pilot

Push a branch, create a PR, loop through reviews until clean, then squash-merge.

## Input

The skill works in the current working directory (or a specified worktree path). It needs:

- A branch with committed changes ready to push
- Optionally an existing PR number (skips push and PR creation)

If invoked with arguments, parse them for:
- `#{number}` or a PR number — existing PR to work with
- A path — working directory override

## Workflow

### 1. Push and Create PR

If no existing PR number was provided:

1. **Push the branch**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

2. **Create the PR**:
   ```bash
   PR_NUM=$(gh pr create --fill --json number --jq '.number')
   ```
   If the branch name contains a `T-{number}` prefix, include it in the PR title.

If an existing PR was provided, fetch its details:
```bash
gh pr view {pr_number} --json number,headRefName,state
```

### 1.5 Decide Whether to Run Local Claude Review

Run `local-review` by default. Skip it only when the upstream `anthropics/claude-code-action` GitHub Action is already going to post the same comment, so the two don't duplicate each other.

An active GH Action review = a workflow file GitHub will execute (extension `*.yml` or `*.yaml`) that references the upstream action. Anything else (no workflow, file renamed to `*.yml.disabled`, `.bak`, editor swap, etc.) means the GH Action will not run, so `local-review` should fill the gap.

```bash
RUN_LOCAL_REVIEW=1
ACTIVE=$(find .github/workflows -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -name '*.yml' -o -name '*.yaml' \) 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$ACTIVE" ] && printf '%s\n' "$ACTIVE" | xargs grep -lq 'anthropics/claude-code-action' 2>/dev/null; then
  RUN_LOCAL_REVIEW=0
fi
```

If `RUN_LOCAL_REVIEW=0`, skip every "Run Local Claude Review" step below — the GH Action will post the review comment on its own.

### 2. Review Loop

#### 2.1 Run Local Claude Review and Wait for CI

If `RUN_LOCAL_REVIEW=1`, invoke the `local-review` agent on the PR (pass the PR number from step 1) so the Claude review comment is posted from your local subscription instead of being produced by GitHub Actions. The agent reads the repo's `CLAUDE.md`, fetches `gh pr diff`, and posts one `gh pr comment` that `pr-review-fixer` will absorb in step 2.2 alongside any other reviewer comments.

Then wait 10 minutes after the PR was created (or after the last push) to allow CI checks and other reviewer comments to arrive.

#### 2.2 Run PR Review Fixer

Run the `/pr-review-fixer` skill to fetch unresolved PR comments and CI failures, validate them, and fix any issues found.

After the skill completes, evaluate the results:
- **CLEAN**: No blockers, critical, or major issues were found. Minor and nitpick items are acceptable.
- **HAS_ISSUES**: There were blockers, critical, or major items that were fixed and pushed. Another round is needed.

#### 2.3 Evaluate and Repeat

- **HAS_ISSUES**: Wait 10 minutes, then go back to step 2.1.
- **CLEAN**: Proceed to merge.

Cap the loop at 5 iterations. If still not clean after 5 rounds, inform the user and stop. Do not merge.

### 3. Rebase and Merge

#### 3.1 Rebase onto Latest Main

```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

If conflicts arise, resolve them. After resolving:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```

Run the project's test suite and linter to verify the rebase is clean.

#### 3.2 Push Rebased Branch

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

#### 3.3 Run Local Claude Review and Wait for CI

If `RUN_LOCAL_REVIEW=1`, invoke `local-review` again on the PR so the post-rebase diff gets a fresh Claude comment locally. Skip otherwise.

Wait 10 minutes after the force push to allow CI checks and other agent reviewers to run.

Then run `/pr-review-fixer` to check for new review comments and CI failures — agent reviewers will post fresh comments on the rebased code.

- **CLEAN**: Proceed to merge.
- **HAS_ISSUES**: Fix, push, and repeat (up to 3 iterations). If still not clean, inform the user and stop.

#### 3.4 Squash and Merge

```bash
gh pr merge {pr_number} --squash --delete-branch
```

### 4. Summary

Report the outcome:

```
PR #{pr_number} — {MERGED|FAILED}
- Review rounds: N
```
