# Feature Development Workflow

This document describes the structured workflow for developing features using the starwave skills. This workflow ensures proper planning, design, and implementation phases with built-in quality checks and review processes.

## Overview

The workflow follows a four-phase approach:
1. **Requirements Gathering** - Define what needs to be built
2. **Design** - Plan how it will be built
3. **Task Planning** - Break down implementation into actionable steps
4. **Implementation** - Execute tasks incrementally

This is constantly being worked on, and will evolve over time. There are two lanes, with different tool support:

- **Gated starwave lane** (this document): Claude Code only. The approval gates, sub-agent reviews, and skills below are not ported to other tools.
- **PRD authoring**: toolset-agnostic. Works in Claude Code (the `prd` skill), VS Code Copilot (the same skills via the shared `~/.claude/skills` link), the cloud coding agent (via the assets `scripts/align.py` seeds into a repo), and orbit as a headless local executor.

### PRDs

For a small project or a first MVP, skip starwave and use `/prd`: it authors a single standalone PRD (`specs/{prd-name}/prd.md`, one PRD per repository) describing the whole system, and ends there. There is no execution step — nothing derives a task file from a PRD — so work that must react to change or growing complexity belongs in the chain below. See `claude/skills/prd/SKILL.md` for the details. The rest of this document describes the gated starwave lane.

## Getting Started

The recommended way to start a new feature is with the **`/starwave:creating-spec`** skill. This orchestration skill:

1. Assesses the scope of your feature
2. Routes to either the lightweight smolspec workflow or the full spec workflow
3. Guides you through all phases with built-in review gates
4. Offers to create a feature branch when planning is complete

For smaller changes (<80 lines of code, 1-3 files), you can use **`/starwave:smolspec`** directly.

## Starwave Skills

All spec-driven development skills are organized under the `starwave` namespace:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/starwave:creating-spec` | Main entry point - orchestrates the full workflow |
| `/starwave:smolspec` | Lightweight specification for minor changes |
| `/starwave:requirements` | Generate and refine requirements in EARS format |
| `/starwave:design` | Create design documents based on requirements |
| `/starwave:tasks` | Convert designs into actionable task lists |

## Smolspec: Lightweight Specifications

The **`/starwave:smolspec`** skill provides a streamlined alternative to the full spec workflow for smaller changes.

### When to Use Smolspec

Use smolspec when **ALL** of these apply:
- Estimated implementation <80 lines of code
- Affects 1-3 files only
- Single component with minimal dependencies
- Clear requirements that don't need extensive clarification
- No breaking changes or API modifications
- No cross-cutting concerns (security, performance, reliability)

### When to Use Full Spec

Use the full spec workflow (`/starwave:creating-spec`) when **ANY** of these apply:
- Estimated implementation >80 lines of code or >3 files
- Affects multiple subsystems or architectural boundaries
- Requires breaking changes or significant API modifications
- Impacts backward compatibility
- Involves complex business logic or multiple user workflows
- Has significant security, performance, or reliability implications

### Smolspec Process

1. **Research Phase** - Explore codebase, identify affected files, assess complexity
2. **Planning Phase** - Create `smolspec.md` with Overview, Requirements, Implementation Approach, and Risks
3. **Review Phase** - Design-critic agent reviews, user approves
4. **Task Creation** - Generate 4-10 outcome-focused tasks in `tasks.md`

### Smolspec Output

The smolspec workflow produces two files in `specs/{feature_name}/`:

**smolspec.md** - A concise document (<100 lines) containing:
- Overview (2-4 sentences)
- Requirements using MUST/SHOULD/MAY language
- Implementation Approach with specific file paths
- Risks and Assumptions

**tasks.md** - A task list compatible with `/next-task`:
- 4-10 outcome-focused tasks
- Optionally organized into 1-2 phases
- Testing distributed throughout (not consolidated at end)

### Escalation

If during smolspec planning the scope grows beyond the criteria above, the skill will recommend switching to the full spec workflow with `/starwave:requirements`.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (`/starwave:requirements`)

**Purpose**: Generate and refine requirements in EARS format based on feature ideas.

**Process**:
- Generate initial requirements based on user's feature idea
- Create `specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md` file
- Use hierarchical numbered lists with user stories and acceptance criteria
- Iterate with user through clarifying questions until requirements are complete
- Use design-critic sub-agent to critically review requirements
- Use peer-review-validator sub-agent for external validation
- Continue feedback-revision cycle until explicit user approval

**Key Constraints**:
- Must propose feature name based on user preference, branch name, or prompt content
- Must wait for user confirmation of feature name
- Must ask general questions important to requirements (e.g., backwards compatibility)
- Must use AskUserQuestion tool when offering options to the user
- Must ask clarifying questions until everything is clear
- Must get explicit approval before proceeding
- Must document decisions in `decision_log.md`

### Phase 2: Design (`/starwave:design`)

**Purpose**: Develop design document based on approved requirements.

**Process**:
- Verify requirements.md exists
- Conduct research using available tools (context7, web search)
- Create detailed `specs/{feature_name}/design.md` with required sections:
  - Overview
  - Architecture
  - Components and Interfaces
  - Data Models
  - Error Handling
  - Testing Strategy
- Include Mermaid diagrams when appropriate
- Use design-critic sub-agent to challenge design decisions
- Use peer-review-validator sub-agent for second opinion
- Get explicit user approval

**Key Constraints**:
- Must follow decisions from decision_log.md
- Must address all requirements
- Must incorporate research findings
- Must use AskUserQuestion tool when asking for input on technical decisions
- Cannot proceed without user approval

### Phase 3: Task Planning (`/starwave:tasks`)

**Purpose**: Create actionable implementation plan with coding tasks.

**Process**:
- Verify requirements.md and design.md exist
- Convert design into series of prompts for code-generation
- Create numbered checkbox list in `specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md`
- Focus on test-driven development and incremental progress
- Reference specific requirements for each task
- Ensure tasks build incrementally
- Identify any user prerequisites and create `prerequisites.md` if needed

**Key Constraints**:
- Tasks must involve writing, modifying, or testing code only
- No deployment, user testing, or non-coding activities in tasks.md
- Maximum two levels of hierarchy (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)
- Must get explicit user approval
- Manual setup tasks (Xcode config, cloud console, etc.) go in prerequisites.md

### Phase 4: Implementation (`/next-task`)

**Purpose**: Implement the next unfinished group of tasks from the task list.

**Process**:
- Use `rune next --format json` to retrieve the next unfinished task group
- Read all referenced files from front_matter_references
- Implement selected main task and ALL subtasks
- Mark completed tasks using `rune complete {task_id}`
- Stop after completing the task group for user review

**Key Constraints**:
- Must use rune CLI for task retrieval and completion tracking
- If only a single top-level task is returned, must re-run with `--phase` flag to get the full phase
- Must implement entire task group (all selected tasks and subtasks)
- Cannot proceed past selected task without user review
- Should use appropriate tools and sub-agents during implementation

## File Structure

All feature-related files are stored in `specs/{feature_name}/`:
```
specs/
└── {feature_name}/
    ├── requirements.md    # EARS format requirements
    ├── design.md          # Comprehensive design document
    ├── tasks.md           # Implementation task checklist
    ├── decision_log.md    # Decisions and rationales
    └── prerequisites.md   # (Optional) Manual setup tasks for the user
```

For smolspec features:
```
specs/
└── {feature_name}/
    ├── smolspec.md       # Combined requirements and design
    ├── tasks.md          # Implementation task checklist
    └── decision_log.md   # Decisions and rationales (if needed)
```

## Key Principles

1. **Incremental Progress**: Each phase builds on the previous one
2. **User Approval**: Explicit approval required at each phase
3. **Documentation**: All decisions captured in decision_log.md
4. **Test-Driven**: Implementation focuses on testable, incremental steps
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Planning vs. implementation are distinct phases
6. **Review Cycles**: Sub-agents provide feedback at each stage

## Usage Tips

- Use `/starwave:creating-spec` as your starting point for new features
- The orchestrator will assess scope and recommend the appropriate workflow
- Use the current git branch name as the feature name when possible
- Ensure each phase is fully approved before moving to the next
- The workflow creates planning artifacts only - implementation is separate
- Tasks should be concrete and actionable by coding agents
- Each task group should be reviewed before proceeding to the next

## Additional Skills

### Commit Management (`/commit`)

**Purpose**: Format, stage, and commit changes with proper changelog management.

**Process**:
- Run all formatting and test commands
- Stage all changes (or review already staged changes)
- Create a concise summary in keepachangelog.com format
- Update CHANGELOG.md with the summary
- Extract ticket number from branch name (JIRA or GitHub issue)
- Create a multi-line commit message with appropriate prefix
- Commit the changes

**Key Constraints**:
- Must not revert code changes unless specifically asked
- Must exclude changelog changes from the summary
- Must use proper commit message prefixes ([feat], [bug], [doc], or ticket number)
- Must not include co-authored-by information

### Release Preparation (`/release-prep`)

**Purpose**: Prepare the project for a new release with quality checks and documentation updates.

**Process**:
- Run all tests and linting checks
- Check for unresolved TODO/FIXME comments
- Verify dependencies are up to date
- Update version numbers across all relevant files
- Condense unreleased changelog entries into focused release notes
- Update documentation for new features
- Prepare structured release notes with breaking changes highlighted

**Key Constraints**:
- Must not commit, tag, or create releases (user handles these)
- Must condense internal changes in changelog to focus on final user-facing results
- Must highlight breaking changes prominently
- Must verify CI/CD pipelines are passing

### Code Review (`pre-push-code-reviewer` agent)

**Purpose**: Critical review of unpushed commits before pushing to remote.

**Process**:
- Identify commits not yet pushed to remote
- Locate relevant specifications for the feature
- Review code for spec adherence, quality, testing, and documentation
- Run validation tools (linters, formatters)
- Provide actionable feedback categorized by severity

**Usage**: Invoke this agent when you want to review local commits before pushing to ensure quality.

### Spec Hygiene (`/spec-janitor`)

**Purpose**: Audit and repair a diluted `specs/` directory — broken cross-references, unparseable task files, duplicate or silently superseded specs, contradictions, mis-filed items.

**When to run**: When the specs directory needs a cleanup or audit pass, typically after messy parallel or autonomous work has layered unreconciled edits onto specs. It is interactive-entry only — no router dispatches it autonomously.

**Process**:
- Two-tier audit: the mechanical auditor (`spec_lint.py`) finds structural breakage; the skill layers a judgment audit on top (duplicates, supersession gaps, scope mismatch, ghost changes, filing errors)
- Tiered repair authority: findings with exactly one correct fix are auto-fixed; everything else is gated on explicit batch approval; findings that need authored content are report-only
- Every finding cites a stable `SJ-*` rule ID from the conventions reference; declined findings can be durably excluded via `specs/.janitor.json`

**Surface capability**:

| Surface | Capability |
|---------|-----------|
| Claude Code | Full: audit, auto-fix, gated repair, exclusion triage |
| VS Code Copilot | Full (same skill via the shared symlink) |
| Cloud coding agent | Report-only: the seeded agent asset runs the auditor without `--fix` |
